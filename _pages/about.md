I am a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Toronto, working with Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) in the [Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/). Additionally, I have been privileged to collaborate with Prof. [Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io/) from the National University of Singapore and with Dr. [Weiyu Liu](https://www.weiyuliu.com/) from Stanford University. 

My research focuses on robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, with a particular interest in enabling robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks through simple human instructions, such as "cook the egg." Iâ€™m currently exploring robot generalization and safety across tasks, objects, and environments to advance this goal.
