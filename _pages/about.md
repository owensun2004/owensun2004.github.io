I am a Ph.D. student in the [Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto, advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/). 
My research interest lies in 3D computer vision and robotics. I am especially excited by robot perception and action algorithms that can generalize and adapt to novel environments. 
Now I am enthusiastically exploring open-world 3D scene understanding algorithms that can leverage the power of 2D foundation models. 

During my Ph.D., I did an internship at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) on egocentric 3D perception, working closely with [Zhaoyang Lv](https://lvzhaoyang.github.io/) and [Chris Sweeney](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h-CpQGgAAAAJ&hl=en). 


Prior to this, I obtained an M.S. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and Prof. [Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/). I received my Bachelor's degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I have been lucky to work with Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang/bio-sketch-review.htm) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yuwing). I also had an internship at [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open).
